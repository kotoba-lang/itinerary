(ns kotoba.itinerary
  "Scheduled legs, connection legality and itinerary construction — pure
  data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the journey-planning half of a
  fare search. `kotoba-lang/reservation` answers *how many are left to
  sell* and *what this one costs* for a SINGLE operator's own inventory.
  It cannot answer the question a shopping engine is actually asked:
  **which sequences of flights actually get someone from A to B, and are
  they legally connectable?**

  That is what this namespace is. Given a pool of scheduled legs it
  builds the itineraries that connect, and — the part that matters for
  this fleet — it lets a governor RECOMPUTE the legality of an itinerary
  an advisor proposed, rather than restating the advisor's claim. See
  `violations`.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM. No
  network, no I/O, no ambient clock.

  ## Time is integer minutes since the epoch, and always an argument

  Connection legality is arithmetic on instants, so every leg carries
  `:leg/depart-min` and `:leg/arrive-min` — integer minutes since
  1970-01-01T00:00Z. Local wall-clock strings may ride along for display
  (`:leg/depart` / `:leg/arrive`) but nothing here ever computes with
  them.

  Nothing in this namespace reads a clock. A governor recomputing an
  itinerary's legality an hour later must reach the same verdict, so
  \"now\" is never ambient.

  ## What this library does NOT know

  Stated up front, because a shopping engine that quietly guesses at
  these is worse than one that refuses:

  - **No timezone database.** `datetime->minutes` takes the UTC offset as
    an argument. Deriving \"Asia/Tokyo on this date\" needs tzdata, which
    is a real dependency with a real update cadence; pretending to know
    it from a three-letter airport code is how a shopping engine sells a
    connection that does not exist.
  - **No published MCT table.** `mct-for` is the LOOKUP STRUCTURE for
    minimum connect times (per airport, per carrier pair, online vs
    interline), not the data. Real MCTs are published per
    airport/terminal/carrier-pair and change; an operator supplies their
    own table.
  - **No co-terminal knowledge.** HND and NRT are different airports
    here. A caller that wants them treated as one origin runs `build`
    once per airport and concatenates.
  - **No mileage data.** `kotoba.fare` checks maximum-permitted-mileage
    against segment mileages the caller supplies; neither library ships
    a distance table."
